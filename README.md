## About JamBuddy

JamBuddy uses real-time audio analysis to listen the way a musician listens. Pick up your guitar, play, and JamBuddy keeps up — detecting chords, identifying keys, and visualizing harmonic relationships as they happen.

Built for intermediate musicians who have hit a wall and need something that actually listens.
