        <div class="whatif-body">
          <p>Musicians don't have magical ears, but they have practice. They don't just hear sound &mdash; they hear a G minor chord resolving to a C major, a melody sitting in the Dorian mode, a rhythm pushing slightly ahead of the beat. That instant, intuitive analysis is what separates a trained ear.</p>
          <p>JamBuddy brings the musician's ear to your pocket. Using real-time audio analysis, it listens the way a musician listens, and understands harmony and context as it happens.</p>

          <p>We live in the age of information. Every chord, every scale, every technique has a tutorial. Learning to play has never been more accessible &mdash; and yet, millions of musicians hit a wall.</p>
          <p>They can hold the guitar. They can strum the chords. They've memorized a few songs. But they can't move forward.</p>
          <p>JamBuddy is built for them &mdash; because for the first time, there's something on the other end that actually listens.</p>
